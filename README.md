# Student Management System  
A clean and modern web-based interface for managing student records. Built using **HTML** and **CSS**, this project demonstrates the structure and design of an academic dashboard, focusing on usability, clarity, and responsive layout techniques.

This project was created for learning and practicing front-end development fundamentals, including layout composition, UI components, and styling with modern CSS.

## Features

### Dashboard Statistics
The interface provides a quick overview of important data:
- **Total Students**
- **Average GPA**
- **Honors Students**
- **Available Majors**

Each statistic is displayed in a dedicated card with an icon for visual clarity.

### Search & Filter
Users can:
- Search students by **name, ID, or email**
- Filter the list by **major** using a dropdown menu

This improves navigation and makes it easy to find specific students.

### Student Table
A clean and structured table displays:
- Full name  
- Age  
- Major  
- GPA  
- Action buttons (Edit / Delete)

The table simulates how real dashboards manage academic records.

### Add New Student Form
A styled grid-based form allows adding new student entries.  
The form includes:
- Full Name  
- Email  
- Age  
- Major selection  
- GPA input  
- Optional notes  

The design focuses on readability, accessibility, and easy interaction.
